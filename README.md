## Build Setup

Using [vue-gh-pages](https://github.com/KieferSivitz/vue-gh-pages) to deploy Vue.js app to gh-pages. Hereâ€™s an alternate manual process: https://medium.com/@mwolfhoffman/deploying-to-github-pages-with-vue-webpack-cli-5b2ba17f14a0

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# build and deploy to GitHub pages
npm run deploy
```
